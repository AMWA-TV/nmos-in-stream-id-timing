# **[Work in progress]** In-stream Signaling of Identity and Timing information for NMOS Flows

This repository contains details of this AMWA Specification for signaling Source and Flow identifiers and Grain timestamps within streams.

The current specification is applicable to RTP streams using any payload format, via the use of RTP header extensions. Mapping of Grain attributes to transport types other than RTP may be specified in later revisions.

## Getting started

Readers are advised to be familiar with the NMOS Technical Overview at (https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos) and then read [specifications/IdentityTimingRTP.txt](specifications/IdentityTimingRTP.txt) in this repository
